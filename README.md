# NLP projects using python


### Project1 --> Twitter sentiment analysis - Brexit

Brexit was a very intense topic for all the people around the world not just in UK/EU last year. Social media was used by people and politicians to prove their points and resultant there were comments, tweets and posts in support and against. The idea behind this small project was to get familiar with tweepy and also to classify the tweets as positive, negative and neutral. 

1) Create a corpus/collection - Tweepy to gather sample text data from Twitter’s API for a(or more) particular search query.
2) Text analysis — analyzing the sentiment for each tweet and classfied them accordingly.
3) Story telling — Visualize the results using basic plot libraries.
    
After analysing the data it was found that the data will require some preprocessing in order to avoid incorrect classfication. 
e.g. few tweets are not against the brexits but they shows signs of negative sentiment so, was classified as negative.
